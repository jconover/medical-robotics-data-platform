# Medical Robotics Surgery Data Platform

A comprehensive DevOps portfolio project demonstrating AWS infrastructure, data engineering, and modern cloud practices using a realistic medical robotics scenario.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a **medical robotics data platform** that collects, stores, and analyzes data from surgical robots performing minimally invasive procedures. It showcases:

- Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)
- Container orchestration (ECS & EKS)
- Data engineering pipelines
- Cloud-native AWS services
- DevOps best practices
- Data warehousing and analytics

## Architecture

The platform ingests data from surgical robots and processes it through multiple AWS services:

```
Surgical Robots (Simulated)
    ↓
[Data Ingestion Service - ECS/EKS]
    ↓
[RDS PostgreSQL] ← Transactional data
[S3 Data Lake]   ← High-volume telemetry
    ↓
[ETL Pipeline]
    ↓
[Redshift Data Warehouse] ← Analytics
```

## Technologies Used

- Infrastructure testing
- Cost optimization strategies
- Grafana dashboards
- Complete documentation and architecture diagrams

## Data Model

The platform tracks surgical robot operations with five core entities:

1. **surgical_robots**: Robot inventory (model, manufacturer, facility, status)
2. **surgical_procedures**: Individual surgeries (type, duration, surgeon, patient)
3. **procedure_telemetry**: Real-time sensor data (arm position, force feedback, camera)
4. **procedure_outcomes**: Post-op results (success, complications, recovery)
5. **robot_maintenance_logs**: Service records (maintenance type, downtime, cost)

See [Phase 1 Data Model](./phase1-data-model/data_model/schema.md) for complete details.

## Getting Started

### Phase 1: Generate Sample Data

```bash
cd phase1-data-model

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate all data
cd data_generators
python generate_all.py

# Review generated data
ls -lh sample_data/
```

This creates ~50-60 MB of realistic medical robotics data.

### Future Phases

Additional setup instructions will be added as each phase is completed.

## Sample Data Statistics

Generated data includes:
- **50 surgical robots** across 10 hospital facilities
- **5,000 surgical procedures** over 2 years (2023-2024)
- **460,000 telemetry records** (100 samples per procedure)
- **5,000 procedure outcomes** with complications and recovery metrics
- **200 maintenance logs** with service history

## Use Cases Demonstrated

This project demonstrates real-world DevOps scenarios:

1. **Multi-tier data storage**: Choosing appropriate storage (RDS, S3, Redshift) based on data characteristics
2. **Infrastructure as Code**: Reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure
3. **Container orchestration**: Comparing ECS and EKS for different use cases
4. **Data pipeline engineering**: ETL processes for analytics
5. **Security best practices**: VPC design, IAM policies, encryption
6. **Cost optimization**: Appropriate service sizing and resource management
7. **Monitoring and observability**: CloudWatch, logging, alerting

## Why Medical Robotics?

Medical robotics provides a compelling use case because:

- **Realistic complexity**: Requires multiple data types and storage strategies
- **High data volume**: Telemetry data demonstrates handling large datasets
- **Compliance considerations**: Shows understanding of sensitive data handling
- **Business value**: Analytics drive procedure improvements and robot maintenance
- **Interesting domain**: Makes portfolio projects more engaging

**Note**: All data is completely synthetic and fictional. No real patient information is used.

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate comprehensive AWS knowledge
- Show DevOps best practices and automation
- Display data engineering skills
- Create production-quality infrastructure code
- Build a portfolio piece that stands out

## Cleanup & Teardown

### Complete Cleanup (All Phases) - Recommended

Delete all infrastructure in the correct dependency order:

```bash
export ENVIRONMENT_NAME="medrobotics"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# Delete everything
./scripts/cleanup-all-phases.sh

# Verify complete deletion
./scripts/verify-cleanup.sh
```

**What it deletes (in order):**
1. Phase 5: EKS cluster (if exists)
2. Phase 4: Redshift, Lambda ETL, Step Functions
3. Phase 3: ECS services, ALB, ECR images
4. Phase 2: VPC, RDS, S3, IAM, Security Groups

### Individual Phase Cleanup

⚠️ **Important:** You must delete phases in reverse order (5 → 4 → 3 → 2) due to CloudFormation cross-stack dependencies.

```bash
# Phase 4 (Redshift)
cd phase4-redshift/scripts && ./cleanup.sh

# Phase 3 (ECS)
cd phase3-ecs/scripts && ./cleanup-ecs.sh

# Phase 2 (Infrastructure) - Will fail if Phase 3/4 still exist
cd phase2-infrastructure/scripts && ./cleanup-infrastructure.sh
```

**For detailed instructions and troubleshooting, see [CLEANUP_GUIDE.md](./CLEANUP_GUIDE.md).**

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Real-time streaming with Kinesis
- Machine learning for predictive maintenance
- Lambda functions for serverless processing
- API Gateway for external access
- DynamoDB for session management
- SNS/SQS for event-driven architecture
